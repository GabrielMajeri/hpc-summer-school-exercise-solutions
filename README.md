# High-Performance Computing Summer School &mdash; Homework solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the homework exercises assigned during the [MÄƒgurele Summer School for Computing in a Rapidly Evolving Society: Parallel Algorithms and Optimizations](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10842/).

The lecture materials, sample code and problem statements can be found [here](https://github.com/ICTP/SMR4077). They were developed locally and then ran/tested on the [Leonardo supercomputer](https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/) of CINECA, to which we had access during the school.
